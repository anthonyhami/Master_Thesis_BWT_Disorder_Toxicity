# Master thesis: Toxicity and Disorder: Investigating Usersâ€™ Online Behaviour Through the Lens of the Broken Windows Theory

## Abstract

This thesis aims to transfer the knowledge of the BWT from offline to online environments to determine if perceived disorder in an online environment increases toxic commenting behaviour. To accomplish this aim, the social media platform Reddit was selected as the online environment to be analysed. It had a major design change from a disordered to a less disordered website design, where a "before" and "after" analysis of two subreddits (r/relationships and r/relationship\_advice) with the same topic was completed. In addition to the Natural Language Processing methods, four approaches were employed to study the aim: Descriptive, content-based, user-based and submission-based.
